        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This schnitzel sandwich is an homage to my time spent in Austria. It's something you might find on a snack cart on the street in Austria or Germany. A tender chicken schnitzel inside a crusty sub roll with lettuce, mayo, lemon juice, and mustard. A simple and delicious sandwich that can be made with leftovers if desired! It goes perfectly with a beer and a handful of chips. Disclaimer! This is not my own recipe.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>4 sandwich rolls, split</li>
        <li>lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>4 dashes hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>4 leaves chopped romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Place chicken between two sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface; firmly pound with smooth side of a meat mallet to an even thickness. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Prepare a breading station: Pour flour into a large, flat dish. Beat eggs thoroughly in a shallow bowl. Pour bread crumbs into another large, flat dish.</li>
        <li>Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, dip in beaten eggs, and coat with bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cooked breaded chicken in batches until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on an ovenproof plate lined with paper towels. Keep warm in the oven.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise over bottom half of each sandwich roll; top with 1 piece of breaded chicken, a few drops of lemon juice, 1 dash hot sauce, and 1 lettuce leaf. Spread mustard over the top half of each sandwich roll. Place top halves over lettuce to form sandwiches.</li>
        </ol>
