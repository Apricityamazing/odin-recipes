        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a Mexican-inspired version of cotoletta alla Milanese, served on a bun and dressed with Mexican-style fixings. Spicy breaded chicken breast gets sandwiched between a toasted Mexican bun and then topped with spicy spread, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and pickled vegetables. Disclaimer! This is not my own recipe.

            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/3 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 bolillo rolls, sliced in half lengthwise</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil</li>
            <li>1/2 avocado, sliced</li>
            <li>3 slices tomato</li>
            <li>2 lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pickled carrots</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pickled jalapeno peppers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Seal chicken breast in a resealable zip-top plastic bag. Pound flat to 1/4-inch thickness. Add cornstarch and shake to coat.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken breast thrugh egg; leave it in the bowl. Add bread crumbs, cilantro, chipotle, oregano, cumin, and pepper to the bag; shake well. Lift chicken from the bowl, letting any excess egg drip off. Add to bread crumb mixture. Shake and press seasoned bread crumbs over chicken breast.</li>
            <li>Place bolillo buns in the preheated oven until warmed through and toasted, about 12 minutes</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix mayonnaise and hot sauce together in a small mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until browned, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken in half, lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Assemble sandwiches. Spread spiciy mayonnaise over both sides of the rolls. Add equal amounts of avocado, tomato, lettuce, carrots, and jalapaños to 2 halves. Add chicken and tops of rolls. Serve with remaining spicy mayonnaise for dipping.</li>
